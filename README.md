Transactional replication sandbox from SQL Server to Azure SQL Database.

## Setup

Copy the template variables file:

```sh
cp config/template.tfvars .auto.tfvars
```

Set your IP address in the `allowed_ip_address` variable.

Create the infrastructure:

```sh
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## SQL Server installation

Select the respective SQL Server version. Evaluation links:

- [SQL Server 2022 Evaluation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server-2022)
- [SQL Server 2019 Evaluation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server-2019)

If the Replication feature is not selected on installed, it need to be added using **SQL Server Installation Center**. Make sure to install it to the existing installation if you chose the Basic install option.

The installation media should be like this: `C:\SQL2019\Evaluation_ENU`.

Create a new local users `<local system>\sqlserver` and `<local system>\sqlagent` with `Administrator` privileges that will be used for the replication agent. In production, check the documentation for a least-privilege approach. Make sure to add the login and permissions to the user.

Setting up the SQL Server **AND** SQL Server Agent user account using the SQL Server Configuration Manager. Apply to restart the service.

ðŸ‘‰ Also, enable [Agent XPs][1] that will be required for replication (check the article version to match the installation version).

Make sure that the agent is running:

## Distributor

The Distributor instance must be set as it's own distributor so it can be used by the Publisher server.

```

Replication must be installed.

Activate SQL Server Agent (Agent XPs).

## Publisher

With the Replication feature enabled, proceed with the Publisher setup.

Create a new database to be used for replication. This procedure will use a new database `contosodb`. Create tables and and insert values to have some sample data. Refer to the [tsql](./tsql/) directory for examples.

The Distributor instance server must have been configured. For simpler setups the `Publisher` can act as its own `Distributor`.

```

Create a new Publication:

As the wizard will prompt:

- Select the data and database objects you want to replicate.
- Filter the published data so that Subscribers receive only the data that they need.

The Publication Type for this exercise will be **Transaction publication**.

A primary key is **mandatory** for transactional replication.

Filters may also be added to the replication settings:

Snapshots can be created to quick start new Subscriptions:

In the agent security step, select the user you previously created:

<img src=".assets/agent-security.png" />

The replication monitor should display the status as **OK**. Make sure to check all tabs.

## Subscription

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/replication-to-sql-database?view=azuresql

Add a new Subscriber and follow the wizard steps. Set the Azure SQL database information for the Subscriber. It must use SQL credentials. For the agent security, use the same user created for the distributor.

<img src=".assets/azure-subscriber.png" />

For real-time sync, select `Run continuously`:

After setting it up, make sure to confirm the subscriber status is OK in the Replication Monitor:
